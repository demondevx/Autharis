# 🌟 Welcome to Autharis!

Hello! Welcome to **Autharis**, your community’s new guardian. Developed by **DemonDev**, Autharis is built to keep your Discord server safe, transparent, and professional.

Unlike regular bots, Autharis follows a "Safety First" approach. It makes sure that powerful administrative tools are only used when absolutely necessary and by the right people.

---

## 🛡️ The Two Pillars of Protection

Autharis works using two main systems that keep your server running smoothly:

### 1. The Elevation System (Secure Admin Access)
In most servers, admins have their powers active 24/7. This is risky! If an admin's account is ever hacked, the whole server is in danger.
**Elevation** fixes this. Admins toggle their powers "on" only when they need to work, and they must verify their identity using a code on their phone (2FA). Once they're done, their powers automatically turn off.

### 2. The Honeypot System (The Raider Trap)
Spam bots and raiders often join servers and immediately start posting in every channel they see.
The **Honeypot** is a "secret" trap channel. If anyone (usually a bot) sends a message there, Autharis catches them instantly and removes them from the server before they can cause any real trouble.

## 🔑 Using the Elevation System

### `/elevate-register`
*   **Who can use it:** Any staff member who needs admin powers.
*   **What it does:** This is your first step! It gives you a special QR code to scan with an app (like Google Authenticator). This links your phone to the bot so you can securely identify yourself.
*   **Outcome:** You are now ready to use "Elevated" powers.

### `/elevate`
*   **Who can use it:** Staff who have registered and are "Trusted" by the owner.
*   **What it does:** When you need to do admin work (like changing server settings or managing roles), run this. It will ask for the code from your phone.
*   **Outcome:** You gain your administrative powers for a short time (e.g., 15 minutes). After that, they are removed automatically to keep you safe!

### `/elevate-reset`
*   **Who can use it:** Anyone who lost access to their 2FA app.
*   **What it does:** If you lose your phone, you can use one of the backup codes you were given during registration to reset your access.
*   **Outcome:** Your 2FA is cleared so you can register again.

### `/reset-account`
*   **Who can use it:** Everyone.
*   **What it does:** Deletes all your personal security data from the bot. Use this if you no longer want to use the security features.

## ⚙️ Managing the Server (Owners & Admins Only)

### `/elevate-config`
*   **Who can use it:** Server Owners / High-level Admins.
*   **What it does:** This is where you set the rules for your server. You choose which role is the "Admin" role, how long a session should last, and where you want security logs to be sent.
*   **Outcome:** Your server's security policy is live!

### `/elevate-trust`
*   **Who can use it:** Server Owners.
*   **What it does:** Marks a specific member as "Trusted." Even if a user has the right role, they cannot use `/elevate` until the owner specifically trusts them. This is an extra layer of protection.

### `/elevate-untrust`
*   **Who can use it:** Server Owners.
*   **What it does:** Removes a user from the trusted list. They will immediately lose any active admin powers.

## 🍯 Setting up the Honeypot

### `/honeypot-setup`
*   **Who can use it:** Server Admins.
*   **What it does:** Helps you create or choose a "Trap" channel. You can decide if the bot should **Ban**, **Kick**, or **Softban** anyone who talks there.
*   **Outcome:** A trap is set. Anyone who falls for it is instantly removed and logged.

---

## 📜 Staying Informed

### `/help`
*   **Who can use it:** Everyone!
*   **What it does:** Shows a menu with all the commands and quick guides on how to use them.

## 💡 Pro Tips for a Safe Server
1.  **Never share your backup codes.** Treat them like your house keys!
2.  **Set a reasonable session time.** Usually, 15 or 30 minutes is plenty of time for admin work.
3.  **Hide the Honeypot channel.** Give it a name like `#rules-read-this` or `#announcements` to attract bots, but make sure real humans know not to talk there!
